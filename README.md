Data Sources
===========
Retrieval of definitions are from
- [Ornagai](www.ornagai.com "Ornagai") [API](http://ornagai.pbworks.com/w/page/25703160/Ornagai%20API "Ornagai API") for Myanmar definitions.

Please note that the accuracy, consistency and correctness of definitions are totally up to [Ornagai](www.ornagai.com "Ornagai").

Roadmap
=======
The followings are some of the features that I have in mind. They include, but not limited to:
- Settle on an english dictionary API and provide english language definitions,
- Include phonetics and pronunciation audio,
- Improve design
- Option to choose between unicode/zawgyi or both.
- Myanmar to English translation *(maybe)*
